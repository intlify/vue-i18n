## General Guidelines

Thanks for understanding that English is used as a shared language in this repository.
Maintainers do not use machine translation to avoid miscommunication due to error in translation.
If description of issue / PR are written in non-English languages, those may be closed.

It is of course fine to use non-English language, when you open a PR to translate documents and communicates with other users in same language.

## Issue Reporting Guidelines

- The issue list of this repo is **exclusively** for bug reports and feature requests. Non-conforming issues will be closed immediately.

  - For simple beginner questions, you can get quick answers from [`#vue-i18n` channel of Discord](https://chat.vuejs.org/)

  - For more complicated questions, you can use [the official forum](http://forum.vuejs.org/) or StackOverflow. Make sure to provide enough information when asking your questions - this makes it easier for others to help you!

- Try to search for your issue, it may have already been answered or even fixed in the development branch.

- Check if the issue is reproducible with the latest stable version of Vue. If you are using a pre-release, please indicate the specific version you are using.

- It is **required** that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Issues with no clear repro steps will not be triaged. If an issue labeled "need repro" receives no further input from the issue author for more than 5 days, it will be closed.

- It is recommended that you make a JSFiddle/JSBin/Codepen/CodeSandbox to demonstrate your issue. You could start based with [this template](http://jsfiddle.net/r8qnsfb1/) that already includes the latest version.

- For bugs that involves build setups, you can create a reproduction repository with steps in the README.

- If your issue is resolved but still open, donâ€™t hesitate to close it. In case you found a solution by yourself, it could be helpful to explain how you fixed it.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- The `master` branch is basically just a snapshot of the latest stable release. All development should be done in dedicated branches. **Do not submit PRs against the `master` branch.**

- Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. `master`, and merge back against that branch.

- Work in the `src` folder and **DO NOT** checkin `dist` in the commits.

- If adding new feature:
  - Add accompanying test case.
  - Provide convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it.

- If fixing a bug:
  - Provide detailed description of the bug in the PR. Live demo preferred.
  - Add appropriate test coverage if applicable.

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - we will let GitHub automatically squash it before merging.

- Make sure `npm test` passes. (see [development setup](#development-setup))

### Work Step Example
- Fork the repository from [intlify/vue-i18n-next](https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-next) !
- Create your topic branch from `master`: `git branch my-new-topic origin/master`
- Add codes and pass tests !
- Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some topic'`
- Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-topic`
- Submit a pull request to `master` branch of `intlify/vue-i18n-next` repository !

## Development Setup

You will need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) **version 10+**, and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

After cloning the repo, run:

```bash
$ yarn # install the dependencies of the project
```


A high level overview of tools used:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the development language
- [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) for bundling
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing
- [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) for e2e testing
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting

## Scripts

### `yarn build`

The `build` script builds all build formats.

#### Build Formats

- **`global`**:

  - For direct use via `<script>` in the browser.
  - Note: global builds are not [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) builds. Instead they are built as [IIFEs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE).

- **`esm-bundler`**:

  - Leaves prod/dev branches with `process.env.NODE_ENV` guards (to be replaced by bundler)
  - Does not ship a minified build (to be done together with the rest of the code after bundling)
  - For use with bundlers like `webpack`, `rollup` and `parcel`.

- **`esm`**:

  - For usage via native ES modules imports (in browser via `<script type="module">`, or via Node.js native ES modules support in the future)
  - Inlines all dependencies - i.e. it's a single ES module with no imports from other files
    - This means you **must** import everything from this file and this file only to ensure you are getting the same instance of code.
  - Hard-coded prod/dev branches, and the prod build is pre-minified (you will have to use different paths/aliases for dev/prod)

- **`cjs`**:
  - For use in Node.js server-side rendering via `require()`.
  - The dev/prod files are pre-built, but are dynamically required based on `process.env.NODE_ENV` in `index.js`, which is the default entry when you do `require('vue-i18n')`.

#### Build with Source Maps

Use the `--sourcemap` or `-s` flag to build with source maps. Note this will make the build much slower.

#### Build with Type Declarations

The `--types` or `-t` flag will generate type declarations during the build and in addition:

- Roll the declarations into a single `.d.ts` file.
- Generate an API report in `<projectRoot>/temp/vue-i18n.api.md`. This report contains potential warnings emitted by [api-extractor](https://api-extractor.com/).
- Generate an API model json in `<projectRoot>/temp/vue-i18n.api.json`. This file can be used to generate a Markdown version of the exported APIs.

### `yarn test`

The `yarn test` script simply calls the `jest` binary, so all [Jest CLI Options](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli) can be used. Some examples:

```bash
# run all tests
$ yarn test

# run unit tests
$ yarn test:unit

# run unit test coverages
$ yarn test:coverage

# run unit tests in watch mode
$ yarn test:watch

# run type tests
$ yarn test:type

# run e2e tests
$ yarn test:e2e
```

## Contributing Tests

Unit tests are collocated with directories named `test`. Consult the [Jest docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/using-matchers) and existing test cases for how to write new test specs. Here are some additional guidelines:

Use the minimal API needed for a test case. For example, if a test can be written without involving the reactivity system ra component, it should be written so. This limits the test's exposure to changes in unrelated parts and makes it more stable.
