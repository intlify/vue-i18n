# Optimization


## Performance

As described in "[Different Distribution files](../extra/dist##from-cdn-or-without-a-bundler)" section, Vue I18n offer the following two built ES modules for Bundler.

- message compiler + runtime: **`vue-i18n.esm-bundler.js`**
- runtime only: **`vue-i18n.runtime.esm-bundler.js`**

For bundler, itâ€™s configured to bundle `vue-i18n.esm-bundler.js` with [`@intlify/unplugin-vue-i18n`](https://github.com/intlify/bundle-tools/tree/main/packages/unplugin-vue-i18n) as default. If you want to reduce the bundle size further, you can configure the bundler to use `vue-i18n.runtime.esm-bundler.js`, which is runtime only.

The use of ES Module `vue-i18n.runtime.esm-bundler.js` means that **all locale messages have to pre-compile to Message functions or AST resources**. what this means it improves performance because vue-i18n just only execute Message functions, so no compilation.

:::tip NOTE
Before v9.3, the locale messages will be compiled to Message functions, after v9.3 or later these will be compiled to AST with `@intlify/bundle-tools`.
:::

:::tip NOTE
Before v9.3, all locale messages are compiled with `@intlify/unplugin-vue-i18n`, so the message compiler is not bundled, **bundle size can be reduced**.

After v9.3, since the message compiler is also bundled, the bundle size cannot be reduced. **This is a trade-off**.
About the reason, See [JIT compilation for details](#jit-compilation).
:::

:::danger NOTE
If [CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) is enabled in before v9.3, `vue-i18n.esm-bundler.js` would not work with compiler due to `eval` statements. These statements violate the `default-src 'self'` header. Instead you need to use `vue-i18n.runtime.esm-bundler.js`.
:::

:::warning NOTICE
From v9.3, the CSP issue can be worked around by JIT compilation of the vue-i18n message compiler. See [JIT compilation for details](#jit-compilation).

## How to configure

We can configure these modules with module path using the module resolve alias feature (e.g. `resolve.alias` vite and webpack) of some bundler, but It takes time and effort.
Intlify project provides plugins/loaders for some bundlers, for simplicity

### unplugin-vue-i18n

[`unplugin`](https://github.com/unjs/unplugin) is an unified plugin system for bundle tool such as vite, webpack, rollup, esbuild and etc.

Intlify project is providing [`unplugin-vue-i18n`](https://github.com/intlify/bundle-tools/tree/main/packages/unplugin-vue-i18n) for vite and webpack.

If you do the production build, Vue I18n will automatically bundle the runtime only module

#### Install plugin

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
npm install @intlify/unplugin-vue-i18n -D
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn add @intlify/unplugin-vue-i18n -D
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm add -D @intlify/unplugin-vue-i18n
```

:::


#### Configure plugin for vite

```js
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { resolve, dirname } from 'node:path'
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url'
import VueI18nPlugin from '@intlify/unplugin-vue-i18n/vite'

export default defineConfig({
  /* ... */
  plugins: [
    /* ... */
    VueI18nPlugin({
      /* options */
      // locale messages resource pre-compile option
      include: resolve(dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)), './path/to/src/locales/**'),
    }),
  ],
})
```

#### Configure plugin for webpack

```js
// webpack.config.js
const path = require('path')
const VueI18nPlugin = require('@intlify/unplugin-vue-i18n/webpack')

module.exports = {
  /* ... */
  plugins: [
    /* ... */
    VueI18nPlugin({
      /* options */
      // locale messages resource pre-compile option
      include: path.resolve(__dirname, './path/to/src/locales/**'),
    })
  ]
}
```

#### More configuration

### Quasar CLI

No need to do anything. [Quasar CLI](https://quasar.dev) takes care of the optimizations for you.


## Feature build flags

### Reduce bundle size with tree-shaking

The `esm-bundler` builds now exposes global feature flags that can be overwritten at compile time:

- `__VUE_I18N_FULL_INSTALL__` (enable/disable, in addition to vue-i18n APIs, components and directives all fully support installation: `true`)
- `__VUE_I18N_LEGACY_API__` (enable/disable vue-i18n legacy style APIs support, default: `true`)

The build will work without configuring these flags, however it is **strongly recommended** to properly configure them in order to get proper tree shaking in the final bundle.

About how to configure for bundler, see the [here](#configure-feature-flags-for-bundler).

### JIT compilation

:::tip Support Version
:new: 9.3+
:::

Before v9.3, vue-i18n message compiler precompiled locale messages like AOT (Ahead Of Time).

However, it had the following issues:

- CSP issues: hard to work on service/web workers, edge-side runtimes of CDNs and etc.
- Back-end integration: hard to get messages from back-end such as database via API and localize them dynamically

To solve these issues, JIT (Just In Time) style compilation is supported message compiler.

Each time localization is performed in an application using `$t` or `t` functions, message resources will be compiled on message compiler.

You need to configure the following feature flag with `esm-bundler` build and bundler such as vite:

- `__INTLIFY_JIT_COMPILATION__`  (enable/disable message compiler for JIT style, default: `false`)
- `__INTLIFY_DROP_MESSAGE_COMPILER__`  (enable/disable whether to tree-shake message compiler when we will be bundling, this flag works when `__INTLIFY_JIT_COMPILATION__` is enabled. default: `false`)

:::warning NOTICE
This feature is opted out as default, because compatibility with previous version before v9.3.
:::

:::warning NOTICE
From v10, JIT compilation is enabled by default, so it is no longer necessary to set the `__INTLIFY_JIT_COMPILATION__` flag in the bundler.
:::

About how to configure for bundler, see the [here](#configure-feature-flags-for-bundler).


### Configure feature flags for bundler

- webpack: use [DefinePlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/define-plugin/)
- Rollup: use [@rollup/plugin-replace](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/replace)
- Vite: configured by default, but can be overwritten using the [`define` option](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/a4133c073e640b17276b2de6e91a6857bdf382e1/src/node/config.ts#L72-L76)
- Quasar CLI: configured by default, but can be overwritten using quasar.conf.js > build > [env option](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/handling-process-env#adding-to-process-env)

:::tip NOTE
The replacement value **must be boolean literals** and cannot be strings, otherwise the bundler/minifier will not be able to properly evaluate the conditions.

## Pre translations with extensions

You can use pre-translation(server-side rendering) with vue-i18n-extensions package.

About how to usage, see [here](https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-extensions).
