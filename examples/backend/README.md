# Backend integration & i18n resource compilation

This is an example of back-end integration, and i18n resources compilation

- `vite.config.ts`: define the plugin that is simulated as the back-end
- `db`: simulate the loading of resources from the database
- `scripts/generate.ts`: compile the i18n resources
- `src/locales.ts`: define the i18n resources load function for development and production
